\title{Make a into a logical variable interpreting more than just
TRUE/FALSE.}
\usage{
make.logical(x, na.value = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The vector to convert to a logical value}

\item{na.value}{What should NA be converted into?}
}
\value{
A logical vector
}
\description{
This function will take a vector (logical, numeric, character, or
factor) and convert it into a logical vector.
}
\details{
The values in the vector will be interpreted as follows:

\itemize{
  \item TRUE
  \itemize{
    \item TRUE (as a logical value)
    \item "TRUE" as a character string or factor level
    \item "T" as a character string or factor level
    \item "YES" as a character string or factor level
    \item "Y" as a character string or factor level
    \item nonzero as a numeric (non-factor) value
  }
  \item FALSE
  \itemize{
    \item FALSE (as a logical value)
    \item "FALSE" as a character string or factor level
    \item "F" as a character string or factor level
    \item "NO" as a character string or factor level
    \item "N" as a character string or factor level
    \item zero as a numeric (non-factor) value
  }
}

Factors are converted to characters.  Characters and factor levels
are compared case-insensitively.  Character strings that are not in
the specified list are considered to be NAs.  Logical vectors are
returned with \code{NA} values converted to the \code{na.value}.
