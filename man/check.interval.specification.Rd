\title{Check the formatting of a calculation interval specification data
frame.}
\usage{
check.interval.specification(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The data frame specifying what to calculate during each
time interval}
}
\value{
x The potentially updated data frame with the interval
calculation specification.
}
\description{
Calculation interval specifications are data frames defining what
calculations will be required and summarized from all time
intervals.  Note: parameters which are not requested may be
calculated if it is required for (or computed at the same time as)
a requested parameter.
}
\details{
The data frame columns (with variable type in parentheses) are:
\describe{
  \item{\code{start}}{The starting time (numeric)}
  \item{\code{end}}{The ending time (numeric including Inf)}
  \item{\code{auc.type}}{What type of AUC should be computed: 'AUCinf',
    'AUClast', 'AUCall', or NA (no AUC computed during the current
    interval)}
  \item{\code{half.life}}{The half-life (logical)}
  \item{\code{tfirst}}{The time of the first concentration above the limit
    of quantification (logical)}
  \item{\code{tmax}}{The time of observed maximum concentration (logical)}
  \item{\code{tlast}}{The time of the last concentration above the limit
    of quantification (logical)}
  \item{\code{cmin}}{The observed minimum concentration during the interval
    (logical)}
  \item{\code{cmax}}{The observed maximum concentration (logical)}
  \item{\code{clast.obs}}{The observed last concentration (logical)}
  \item{\code{clast.pred}}{The concentration at \code{tlast} predicted by
    the half life (logical)}
  \item{\code{thalf.eff}}{The effective half-life (logical)}
  \item{\code{aucpext}}{The percent of the AUCinf that is extrapolated after
    the AUClast (logical)}
  \item{\code{cl}}{The clearance (force: 'force' indicates that
    clearance should be calculated even if it is a multiple-dose study
    and the drug has not reached steady-state.)}
  \item{\code{mrt}}{The mean residence time (logical)}
  \item{\code{vz}}{Terminal volume of distribution (logical)}
  \item{\code{vss}}{Steady-state volume of distribution (logical)}
}

The variable types for each column are:
\describe{
  \item{logical}{A logical variable, as interpreted with the
    \code{\link{make.logical}} function.}
  \item{numeric}{A numeric (non-factor) column}
  \item{force}{logical or the text \code{'force'}.  \code{'force'}
    indicates that checking if the calculation is appropriate should be
    skipped.}
  \item{character or factor}{The text suggested as either a character or
    a factor}
}

They are interpreted with the following rules:

\itemize{
  \item The \code{start} time must always be given.
  \item The \code{start} must be before the \code{end} (if \code{end} is
        given)
  \item If the \code{end} time is given, then the other
        specifications (i.e. \code{auc.type} and
        \code{half.life} will only be done in that interval.
  \item If the \code{end} time is NA, then
  \itemize{
    \item No AUCs will be calculated.
    \item It is an error to set \code{auc.type} to anything other than NA.
    \item It is an error to set \code{half.life} to FALSE.
    \item \code{half.life} is computed from the \code{start} to the last
          available measurement.

}
