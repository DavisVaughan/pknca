Description: This package computes standard Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA)
    parameters and summarizes them.  In addition to this core work, it also
    provides standardized plotting routines, basic assessments for
    biocomparison or drug interaction, and model-based estimation routines for
    calculating doses to reach specific values of AUC or Cmax.
